<!-- CHECKLIST: Here's a handy checklist to go through before submitting a PR 
     - Is the commit message formatted correctly?
     - Have you noted the new functionality/bugfix in the release notes of the next release?
     
     (If you've changed any code) 
     - Do all of your functions and methods have docstrings?
     - Have you added/updated unit tests where appropriate? 
     - Have you updated the baseline images if necessary?
     - Have you run the unit tests using `pytest`?
     - Is your code style correct (are you using PEP8, pyflakes)? 
     - Have you documented your new feature/functionality in the docs?
     
     (If you've added to the docs) 
     - Have you built the docs using `make html`? -->
