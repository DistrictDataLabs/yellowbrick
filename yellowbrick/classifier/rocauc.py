class ROCAUC(ClassificationScoreVisualizer):
    """
    Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves are a measure of a
    classifier's predictive quality that compares and visualizes the tradeoff
    between the models' sensitivity and specificity. The ROC curve displays
    the true positive rate on the Y axis and the false positive rate on the
    X axis on both a global average and per-class basis. The ideal point is
    therefore the top-left corner of the plot: false positives are zero and
    true positives are one.

    This leads to another metric, area under the curve (AUC), a computation
    of the relationship between false positives and true positives. The higher
    the AUC, the better the model generally is. However, it is also important
    to inspect the "steepness" of the curve, as this describes the
    maximization of the true positive rate while minimizing the false positive
    rate. Generalizing "steepness" usually leads to discussions about
    convexity, which we do not get into here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : estimator
        A scikit-learn estimator that should be a classifier. If the model is
        not a classifier, an exception is raised. If the internal model is not
        fitted, it is fit when the visualizer is fitted, unless otherwise specified
        by ``is_fitted``.

    ax : matplotlib Axes, default: None
        The axes to plot the figure on. If not specified the current axes will be
        used (or generated if required).

    micro : bool, default: True
        Plot the micro-averages ROC curve, computed from the sum of all true
        positives and false positives across all classes. Micro is not defined
        for binary classification problems with estimators with only a
        decision_function method.

    macro : bool, default: True
        Plot the macro-averages ROC curve, which simply takes the average of
        curves across all classes. Macro is not defined for binary
        classification problems with estimators with only a decision_function
        method.

    per_class : bool, default: True
        Plot the ROC curves for each individual class. This should be set
        to false if only the macro or micro average curves are required. Per-
        class classification is not defined for binary classification problems
        with estimators with only a decision_function method.

    classes : list of str, defult: None
        The class labels to use for the legend ordered by the index of the sorted
        classes discovered in the ``fit()`` method. Specifying classes in this
        manner is used to change the class names to a more specific format or
        to label encoded integer classes. Some visualizers may also use this
        field to filter the visualization for specific classes. For more advanced
        usage specify an encoder rather than class labels.

    encoder : dict or LabelEncoder, default: None
        A mapping of classes to human readable labels. Often there is a mismatch
        between desired class labels and those contained in the target variable
        passed to ``fit()`` or ``score()``. The encoder disambiguates this mismatch
        ensuring that classes are labeled correctly in the visualization.

    is_fitted : bool or str, default="auto"
        Specify if the wrapped estimator is already fitted. If False, the estimator
        will be fit when the visualizer is fit, otherwise, the estimator will not be
        modified. If "auto" (default), a helper method will check if the estimator
        is fitted before fitting it again.

    force_model : bool, default: False
        Do not check to ensure that the underlying estimator is a classifier. This
        will prevent an exception when the visualizer is initialized but may result
        in unexpected or unintended behavior.

    kwargs : dict
        Keyword arguments passed to the visualizer base classes.

    Attributes
    ----------
    classes_ : ndarray of shape (n_classes,)
        The class labels observed while fitting.

    class_count_ : ndarray of shape (n_classes,)
        Number of samples encountered for each class during fitting.

    score_ : float
        An evaluation metric of the classifier on test data produced when
        ``score()`` is called. This metric is between 0 and 1 -- higher scores are
        generally better. For classifiers, this score is usually accuracy, but
        if micro or macro is specified this returns an F1 score.

    Notes
    -----
    ROC curves are typically used in binary classification, and in fact the
    Scikit-Learn ``roc_curve`` metric is only able to perform metrics for
    binary classifiers. As a result it is necessary to binarize the output or
    to use one-vs-rest or one-vs-all strategies of classification. The
    visualizer does its best to handle multiple situations, but exceptions can
    arise from unexpected models or outputs.

    Another important point is the relationship of class labels specified on
    initialization to those drawn on the curves. The classes are not used to
    constrain ordering or filter curves; the ROC computation happens on the
    unique values specified in the target vector to the ``score`` method. To
    ensure the best quality visualization, do not use a LabelEncoder for this
    and do not pass in class labels.

    Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves are a measure of a

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : estimator
        A scikit-learn estimator that should be a classifier. If the model is
        not a classifier, an exception is raised. If the internal model is not
        fitted, it is fit when the visualizer is fitted, unless otherwise specified
        by ``is_fitted``.

    X : ndarray or DataFrame of shape n x m
        A matrix of n instances with m features

    y : ndarray or Series of length n
        An array or series of target or class values

    ax : matplotlib Axes, default: None
        The axes to plot the figure on. If not specified the current axes will be
        used (or generated if required).

    test_size : float, default=0.2
        The percentage of the data to reserve as test data.

    random_state : int or None, default=None
        The value to seed the random number generator for shuffling data.

    micro : bool, default: True
        Plot the micro-averages ROC curve, computed from the sum of all true
        positives and false positives across all classes. Micro is not defined
        for binary classification problems with estimators with only a
        decision_function method.

    macro : bool, default: True
        Plot the macro-averages ROC curve, which simply takes the average of
        curves across all classes. Macro is not defined for binary
        classification problems with estimators with only a decision_function
        method.

    per_class : bool, default: True
        Plot the ROC curves for each individual class. This should be set
        to false if only the macro or micro average curves are required. Per-
        class classification is not defined for binary classification problems
        with estimators with only a decision_function method.

    classes : list of str, defult: None
        The class labels to use for the legend ordered by the index of the sorted
        classes discovered in the ``fit()`` method. Specifying classes in this
        manner is used to change the class names to a more specific format or
        to label encoded integer classes. Some visualizers may also use this
        field to filter the visualization for specific classes. For more advanced
        usage specify an encoder rather than class labels.

    encoder : dict or LabelEncoder, default: None
        A mapping of classes to human readable labels. Often there is a mismatch
        between desired class labels and those contained in the target variable
        passed to ``fit()`` or ``score()``. The encoder disambiguates this mismatch
        ensuring that classes are labeled correctly in the visualization.

    is_fitted : bool or str, default="auto"
        Specify if the wrapped estimator is already fitted. If False, the estimator
        will be fit when the visualizer is fit, otherwise, the estimator will not be
        modified. If "auto" (default), a helper method will check if the estimator
        is fitted before fitting it again.

    force_model : bool, default: False
        Do not check to ensure that the underlying estimator is a classifier. This
        will prevent an exception when the visualizer is initialized but may result
        in unexpected or unintended behavior.

    kwargs : dict
        Keyword arguments passed to the visualizer base classes.

    Notes
    -----
    ROC curves are typically used in binary classification, and in fact the
    Scikit-Learn ``roc_curve`` metric is only able to perform metrics for
    binary classifiers. As a result it is necessary to binarize the output or
    to use one-vs-rest or one-vs-all strategies of classification. The
    visualizer does its best to handle multiple situations, but exceptions can
    arise from unexpected models or outputs.

    Another important point is the relationship of class labels specified on
    initialization to those drawn on the curves. The classes are not used to
    constrain ordering or filter curves; the ROC computation happens on the
    unique values specified in the target vector to the ``score`` method. To
    ensure the best quality visualization, do not use a LabelEncoder for this
    and do not pass in class labels.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from yellowbrick.classifier import ROCAUC
    >>> from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
    >>> data = load_data("occupancy")
    >>> features = ["temp", "relative humidity", "light", "C02", "humidity"]
    >>> X = data[features].values
    >>> y = data.occupancy.values
    >>> roc_auc(LogisticRegression(), X, y)
