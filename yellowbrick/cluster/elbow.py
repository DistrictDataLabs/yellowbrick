class KElbowVisualizer(ClusteringScoreVisualizer):
    """
    The K-Elbow Visualizer implements the "elbow" method of selecting the
    optimal number of clusters for K-means clustering. K-means is a simple
    unsupervised machine learning algorithm that groups data into a specified
    number (k) of clusters. Because the user must specify in advance what k to
    choose, the algorithm is somewhat naive -- it assigns all members to k
    clusters even if that is not the right k for the dataset.

    The elbow method runs k-means clustering on the dataset for a range of
    values for k (say from 1-10) and then for each value of k computes an
    average score for all clusters. By default, the ``distortion_score`` is
    computed, the sum of square distances from each point to its assigned
    center. Other metrics can also be used such as the ``silhouette_score``,
    the mean silhouette  coefficient for all samples or the
    ``calinski_harabaz_score``, which computes the ratio of dispersion between
    and within clusters.

    When these overall metrics for each model are plotted, it is possible to
    visually determine the best value for K. If the line chart looks like an
    arm, then the "elbow" (the point of inflection on the curve) is the best
    value of k. The "arm" can be either up or down, but if there is a strong
    inflection point, it is a good indication that the underlying model fits
    best at that point.

    Parameters
    ----------

    model : a Scikit-Learn clusterer
        Should be an instance of a clusterer, specifically ``KMeans`` or
        ``MiniBatchKMeans``. If it is not a clusterer, an exception is raised.

    ax : matplotlib Axes, default: None
        The axes to plot the figure on. If None is passed in the current axes
        will be used (or generated if required).

    k : integer or tuple
        The range of k to compute silhouette scores for. If a single integer
        is specified, then will compute the range (2,k) otherwise the
        specified range in the tuple is used.

    metric : string, default: ``"distortion"``
        Select the scoring metric to evaluate the clusters. The default is the
        mean distortion, defined by the sum of squared distances between each
        observation and its closest centroid. Other metrics include:

        - **distortion**: mean sum of squared distances to centers
        - **silhouette**: mean ratio of intra-cluster and nearest-cluster distance
        - **calinski_harabaz**: ratio of within to between cluster dispersion

    timings : bool, default: True
        Display the fitting time per k to evaluate the amount of time required
        to train the clustering model.

    kwargs : dict
        Keyword arguments that are passed to the base class and may influence
        the visualization as defined in other Visualizers.

    Examples
    --------

    >>> from yellowbrick.cluster import KElbowVisualizer
    >>> from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
    >>> model = KElbowVisualizer(KMeans(), k=10)
    >>> model.fit(X)
    >>> model.poof()

    Notes
    -----

    If you get a visualizer that doesn't have an elbow or inflection point,
    then this method may not be working. The elbow method does not work well
    if the data is not very clustered; in this case you might see a smooth
    curve and the value of k is unclear. Other scoring methods such as BIC or
    SSE also can be used to explore if clustering is a correct choice.
