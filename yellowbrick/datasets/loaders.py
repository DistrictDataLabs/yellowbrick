    Loads the concrete multivariate dataset that is well suited to regression
    tasks. The dataset contains 1030 instances and 8 real valued attributes
    with a continuous target.

    The Yellowbrick datasets are hosted online and when requested, the dataset
    is downloaded to your local computer for use. Note that if the dataset
    hasn't been downloaded before, an Internet connection is required. However,
    if the data is cached locally, no data will be downloaded. Yellowbrick
    checks the known signature of the dataset with the data downloaded to
    ensure the download completes successfully.

    Datasets are stored alongside the code, but the location can be specified
    with the ``data_home`` parameter or the $YELLOWBRICK_DATA envvar.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data_home : str, optional
        The path on disk where data is stored. If not passed in, it is looked
        up from YELLOWBRICK_DATA or the default returned by ``get_data_home``.

    return_dataset : bool, default=False
        Return the raw dataset object instead of X and y numpy arrays to
        get access to alternative targets, extra features, content and meta.

    Returns
    -------
    X : array-like with shape (n_instances, n_features) if return_dataset=False
        A pandas DataFrame or numpy array describing the instance features.

    y : array-like with shape (n_instances,) if return_dataset=False
        A pandas Series or numpy array describing the target vector.
