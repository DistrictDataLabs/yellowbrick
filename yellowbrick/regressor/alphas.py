##########################################################################

class AlphaSelection(RegressionScoreVisualizer):
    """
    The Alpha Selection Visualizer demonstrates how different values of alpha
    influence model selection during the regularization of linear models.
    Generally speaking, alpha increases the affect of regularization, e.g. if
    alpha is zero there is no regularization and the higher the alpha, the
    more the regularization parameter influences the final model.

    Regularization is designed to penalize model complexity, therefore the
    higher the alpha, the less complex the model, decreasing the error due to
    variance (overfit). Alphas that are too high on the other hand increase
    the error due to bias (underfit). It is important, therefore to choose an
    optimal Alpha such that the error is minimized in both directions.

    To do this, typically you would you use one of the "RegressionCV" models
    in Scikit-Learn. E.g. instead of using the ``Ridge`` (L2) regularizer, you
    can use ``RidgeCV`` and pass a list of alphas, which will be selected
    based on the cross-validation score of each alpha. This visualizer wraps
    a "RegressionCV" model and visualizes the alpha/error curve. Use this
    visualization to detect if the model is responding to regularization, e.g.
    as you increase or decrease alpha, the model responds and error is
    decreased. If the visualization shows a jagged or random plot, then
    potentially the model is not sensitive to that type of regularization and
    another is required (e.g. L1 or ``Lasso`` regularization).

    Parameters
    ----------

    model : a Scikit-Learn regressor
        Should be an instance of a regressor, and specifically one whose name
        ends with "CV" otherwise a will raise a YellowbrickTypeError exception
        on instantiation. To use non-CV regressors see:
        ``ManualAlphaSelection``.

    ax : matplotlib Axes, default: None
        The axes to plot the figure on. If None is passed in the current axes
        will be used (or generated if required).

    kwargs : dict
        Keyword arguments that are passed to the base class and may influence
        the visualization as defined in other Visualizers.

    Examples
    --------

    >>> from yellowbrick.regressor import AlphaSelection
    >>> from sklearn.linear_model import LassoCV
    >>> model = AlphaSelection(LassoCV())
    >>> model.fit(X, y)
    >>> model.poof()

    Notes
    -----

    This class expects an estimator whose name ends with "CV". If you wish to
    use some other estimator, please see the ``ManualAlphaSelection``
    Visualizer for manually iterating through all alphas and selecting the
    best one.

    This Visualizer hooks into the Scikit-Learn API during ``fit()``. In
    order to pass a fitted model to the Visualizer, call the ``draw()`` method
    directly after instantiating the visualizer with the fitted model.

    Note, each "RegressorCV" module has many different methods for storing
    alphas and error. This visualizer attempts to get them all and is known
    to work for RidgeCV, LassoCV, LassoLarsCV, and ElasticNetCV. If your
    favorite regularization method doesn't work, please submit a bug report.

    For RidgeCV, make sure ``store_cv_values=True``.

class ManualAlphaSelection(AlphaSelection):
    """
    The ``AlphaSelection`` visualizer requires a "RegressorCV", that is a
    specialized class that performs cross-validated alpha-selection on behalf
    of the model. If the regressor you wish to use doesn't have an associated
    "CV" estimator, or for some reason you would like to specify more control
    over the alpha selection process, then you can use this manual alpha
    selection visualizer, which is essentially a wrapper for
    ``cross_val_score``, fitting a model for each alpha specified.

    Parameters
    ----------

    model : a Scikit-Learn regressor
        Should be an instance of a regressor, and specifically one whose name
        doesn't end with "CV". The regressor must support a call to
        ``set_params(alpha=alpha)`` and be fit multiple times. If the
        regressor name ends with "CV" a ``YellowbrickValueError`` is raised.

    ax : matplotlib Axes, default: None
        The axes to plot the figure on. If None is passed in the current axes
        will be used (or generated if required).

    alphas : ndarray or Series, default: np.logspace(-10, 2, 200)
        An array of alphas to fit each model with

    cv : int, cross-validation generator or an iterable, optional
        Determines the cross-validation splitting strategy.
        Possible inputs for cv are:

        - None, to use the default 3-fold cross validation,
        - integer, to specify the number of folds in a `(Stratified)KFold`,
        - An object to be used as a cross-validation generator.
        - An iterable yielding train, test splits.

        This argument is passed to the
        ``sklearn.model_selection.cross_val_score`` method to produce the
        cross validated score for each alpha.

    scoring : string, callable or None, optional, default: None
        A string (see model evaluation documentation) or
        a scorer callable object / function with signature
        ``scorer(estimator, X, y)``.

        This argument is passed to the
        ``sklearn.model_selection.cross_val_score`` method to produce the
        cross validated score for each alpha.

    kwargs : dict
        Keyword arguments that are passed to the base class and may influence
        the visualization as defined in other Visualizers.

    Examples
    --------

    >>> from yellowbrick.regressor import ManualAlphaSelection
    >>> from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge
    >>> model = ManualAlphaSelection(
    ...     Ridge(), cv=12, scoring='neg_mean_squared_error'

    This class does not take advantage of estimator-specific searching and is
