def umap(X, y=None, ax=None, classes=None,
           colors=None, colormap=None, alpha=0.7, **kwargs):
    """
    Display a projection of a vectorized corpus in two dimensions using UMAP (Uniform
    Manifold Approximation and Projection),
    a nonlinear dimensionality reduction method that is particularly well
    suited to embedding in two or three dimensions for visualization as a
    scatter plot. UMAP is a relatively new technique but is often used to visualize clusters or
    groups of data points and their relative proximities.  It typically is fast, scalable,
    and can be applied directly to sparse matrices eliminating the need to run a truncatedSVD
    as a pre-processing step.

    The current default for UMAP is Euclidean distance.  Hellinger distance would be a more appropriate distance
    function to use with CountVectorize data.  That will be released in the next version of UMAP.
    In the meantime cosine distance is likely a better text default that Euclidean and can be set using
    the keyword arg metric='cosine'.

    Parameters
    ----------

    X : ndarray or DataFrame of shape n x m
        A matrix of n instances with m features representing the corpus of
        vectorized documents to visualize with umap.

    y : ndarray or Series of length n
        An optional array or series of target or class values for instances.
        If this is specified, then the points will be colored according to
        their class. Often cluster labels are passed in to color the documents
        in cluster space, so this method is used both for classification and
        clustering methods.

    ax : matplotlib axes
        The axes to plot the figure on.

    classes : list of strings
        The names of the classes in the target, used to create a legend.

    colors : list or tuple of colors
        Specify the colors for each individual class

    colormap : string or matplotlib cmap
        Sequential colormap for continuous target

    alpha : float, default: 0.7
        Specify a transparency where 1 is completely opaque and 0 is completely
        transparent. This property makes densely clustered points more visible.

    kwargs : dict
        Pass any additional keyword arguments to the UMAP transformer.

    Returns
    -------
    ax : matplotlib axes
        Returns the axes that the parallel coordinates were drawn on.

## UMAPVisualizer

class UMAPVisualizer(TextVisualizer):
    """
    Display a projection of a vectorized corpus in two dimensions using UMAP,
    a nonlinear dimensionality reduction method that is particularly well
    suited to embedding in two or three dimensions for visualization as a
    scatter plot. UMAP is a relatively new technique but is often used to visualize clusters or
    groups of data points and their relative proximities.  It typically is fast, scalable,
    and can be applied directly to sparse matrices eliminating the need to run a truncatedSVD
    as a pre-processing step.

    UMAP will return a scatter plot of the vectorized corpus, such that each
    point represents a document or utterance. By default, the distance between two points
    in the visual space is embedded using the cosine distance between the high dimensional feature
    vectors.  Thus, UMAP shows the clusters of similar documents and the relationships between
    groups of documents as a scatter plot.

    UMAP can be used with either clustering or classification; by specifying
    the ``classes`` argument, points will be colored based on their similar
    traits. For example, by passing ``cluster.labels_`` as ``y`` in ``fit()``, all
    points in the same cluster will be grouped together. This extends the
    neighbor embedding with more information about similarity, and can allow
    better interpretation of both clusters and classes.

    The current default for UMAP is Euclidean distance.  Hellinger distance would be a more appropriate distance
    function to use with CountVectorize data.  That will be released in the next version of UMAP.
    In the meantime cosine distance is likely a better text default that Euclidean and can be set using
    the keyword argument metric='cosine'.

    Parameters
    ----------

    ax : matplotlib axes
        The axes to plot the figure on.

    labels : list of strings
        The names of the classes in the target, used to create a legend.
        Labels must match names of classes in sorted order.

    colors : list or tuple of colors
        Specify the colors for each individual class

    colormap : string or matplotlib cmap
        Sequential colormap for continuous target

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, optional, default: None
        If int, random_state is the seed used by the random number generator;
        If RandomState instance, random_state is the random number generator;
        If None, the random number generator is the RandomState instance used
        by np.random. The random state is applied to the preliminary
        decomposition as well as UMAP.

    alpha : float, default: 0.7
        Specify a transparency where 1 is completely opaque and 0 is completely
        transparent. This property makes densely clustered points more visible.

    kwargs : dict
        Pass any additional keyword arguments to the UMAP transformer.
