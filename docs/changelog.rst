Version 1.3
------------

* Tag: v1.3_
* Deployed Tuesday, February 9, 2021
* Current Contributors: Benjamin Bengfort, Rebecca Bilbro, Paul Johnson, Philippe Billet, Prema Roman, Patrick Deziel

This version primarily repairs the dependency issues we faced with scipy 1.6, scikit-learn 0.24 and Python 3.6 (or earlier). As part of the rapidly changing Python library landscape, we've been forced to react quickly to dependency changes, even where those libraries have been responsibly issuing future and deprecation warnings.

Major Changes:
   - Implement new ``set_params`` and ``get_params`` on ModelVisualizers to ensure wrapped estimator is being correctly accessed via the new Estimator methods.
   - Freeze the test dependencies to prevent variability in CI (must periodically review dependencies to ensure we're testing what our users are experiencing).
   - Change ``model`` param to ``estimator`` param to ensure that Visualizer arguments match their property names so that inspect works with get and set params and other scikit-learn utility functions.

Minor Changes:
   - Import scikit-learn private API ``_safe_indexing`` without error.
   - Remove any calls to ``set_params`` in Visualizer ``__init__`` methods.
   - Modify test fixtures and baseline images to accommodate new sklearn implementation
   - Set the numpy dependency to be less than 1.20 because this is causing Pickle issues with joblib and umap
   - Add ``shuffle=True`` argument to any CV class that uses a random seed.
   - Set our CI matrix to Python and Miniconda 3.7 and 3.8
   - Correction in README regarding ModelVisualizer API.

Hotfix 1.2.1
------------

* Tag: v1.2.1_
* Deployed Friday, January 15, 2020
* Contributors: Rebecca Bilbro, Benjamin Bengfort, Paul Johnson, Matt Harrison

On December 22, 2020, scikit-learn released version 0.24 which deprecated the external use of scikit-learn's internal utilities such as ``safe_indexing``. Unfortunately, Yellowbrick depends on a few of these utilities and must refactor our internal code base to port this functionality or work around it. To ensure that Yellowbrick continues to work when installed via ``pip``, we have temporarily changed our scikit-learn dependency to be less than 0.24. We will update our dependencies on the v1.3 release when we have made the associated fixes.

.. _v1.2.1: https://github.com/DistrictDataLabs/yellowbrick/releases/tag/v1.2.1


Version 1.2
-----------

* Tag: v1.2_
* Deployed Friday, October 9, 2020
* Current Contributors: Rebecca Bilbro, Larry Gray, Vladislav Skripniuk, David Landsman, Prema Roman, @aldermartinez, Tan Tran, Benjamin Bengfort, Kellen Donohue, Kristen McIntyre, Tony Ojeda, Edwin Schmierer, Adam Morris, Nathan Danielsen

Major Changes:
   - Added Q-Q plot as side-by-side option to the ``ResidualsPlot`` visualizer.
   - More robust handling of binary classification in ``ROCAUC`` visualization, standardizing the way that classifiers with ``predict_proba`` and ``decision_function`` methods are handling. A ``binary`` hyperparameter was added to the visualizer to ensure correct interpretation of binary ROCAUC plots.
   - Fixes to ``ManualAlphaSelection`` to move it from prototype to prime time including documentation, tests, and quick method. This method allows users to perform alpha selection visualization on non-CV estimators.
   - Removal of AppVeyor from the CI matrix after too many out-of-core (non-Yellowbrick) failures with setup and installation on the VisualStudio images. Yellowbrick CI currently omits Windows and Miniconda from the test matrix and we are actively looking for new solutions.
   - Third party estimator wrapper in contrib to provide enhanced support for non-scikit-learn estimators such as those in Keras, CatBoost, and cuML.

Minor Changes:
   - Allow users to specify colors for the ``PrecisionRecallCurve``.
   - Update ``ClassificationScoreVisualizer`` base class to have a ``class_colors_`` learned attribute instead of a ``colors`` property; additional polishing of multi-class colors in ``PrecisionRecallCurve``, ``ROCAUC``, and ``ClassPredictionError``.
   - Update ``KElbowVisualizer`` fit method and quick method to allow passing ``sample_weight`` parameter through the visualizer.
   - Enhancements to classification documentation to better discuss precision and recall and to diagnose with ``PrecisionRecallCurve`` and ``ClassificationReport`` visualizers.
   - Improvements to ``CooksDistance`` visualizer documentation.
   - Corrected ``KElbowVisualizer`` label and legend formatting.
   - Typo fixes to ``ROCAUC`` documentation, labels, and legend. Typo fix to ``Manifold`` documentation.
   - Use of ``tight_layout`` accessing the Visualizer figure property to finalize images and resolve discrepancies in plot directive images in documentation.
   - Add ``get_param_names`` helper function to identify keyword-only parameters that belong to a specific method.
   - Splits package namespace for ``yellowbrick.regressor.residuals`` to move ``PredictionError`` to its own module, ``yellowbrick.regressor.prediction_error``.
   - Update tests to use ``SVC`` instead of ``LinearSVC`` and correct ``KMeans`` scores based on updates to scikit-learn v0.23.
   - Continued maintenance and management of baseline images following dependency updates; removal of mpl.cbook dependency.
   - Explicitly include license file in source distribution via ``MANIFEST.in``.
   - Fixes to some deprecation warnings from ``sklearn.metrics``.
   - Testing requirements depends on Pandas v1.0.4 or later.
   - Reintegrates pytest-spec and verbose test logging, updates pytest dependency to v0.5.0 or later.
   - Added Pandas v0.20 or later to documentation dependencies.

Hotfix 1.0.1
------------

* Tag: v1.0.1_
* Deployed Sunday, October 6, 2019
* Contributors: Benjamin Bengfort, Rebecca Bilbro, Kristen McIntyre

.. warning:: **Major API change**: the ``poof()`` method is now deprecated, please use ``show()`` instead. After a significant discussion with community members we have deprecated our original "make the magic happen" method due to concerns about the usage of the word. We've renamed the original method to and created a stub method with the original name that issues a deprecation warning and calls ``show()``.

Changes:
   - Changes ``poof()`` to ``show()``.
   - Updated clustering and regression example notebooks.
   - Fixes a syntax error in Python 3.5 and earlier.
   - Updated Manifold documentation to fix example bug.
   - Added advisors names to the release changelog.
   - Adds advisory board minutes for Fall 2019.
   - Updates our Travis-CI semi-secure token for Slack integration.

Version 0.4.1
-------------
This release is an intermediate version bump in anticipation of the PyCon 2017 sprints.

The primary goals of this version were to (1) update the Yellowbrick dependencies (2) enhance the Yellowbrick documentation to help orient new users and contributors, and (3) make several small additions and upgrades (e.g. pulling the Yellowbrick utils into a standalone module).

We have updated the scikit-learn and SciPy dependencies from version 0.17.1 or later to 0.18 or later. This primarily entails moving from ``from sklearn.cross_validation import train_test_split`` to ``from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split``.

The updates to the documentation include new Quickstart and Installation guides, as well as updates to the Contributors documentation, which is modeled on the scikit-learn contributing documentation.

This version also included upgrades to the KMeans visualizer, which now supports not only ``silhouette_score`` but also ``distortion_score`` and ``calinski_harabaz_score``. The ``distortion_score`` computes the mean distortion of all samples as the sum of the squared distances between each observation and its closest centroid. This is the metric that KMeans attempts to minimize as it is fitting the model. The ``calinski_harabaz_score`` is defined as ratio between the within-cluster dispersion and the between-cluster dispersion.

Finally, this release includes a prototype of the ``VisualPipeline``, which extends scikit-learn's ``Pipeline`` class, allowing multiple Visualizers to be chained or sequenced together.

* Deployed: Monday, May 22, 2017
* Contributors: Benjamin Bengfort, Rebecca Bilbro, Nathan Danielsen

Changes:
   - Score and model visualizers now wrap estimators as proxies so that all methods on the estimator can be directly accessed from the visualizer
   - Updated scikit-learn dependency from >=0.17.1  to >=0.18
   - Replaced ``sklearn.cross_validation`` with ``model_selection``
   - Updated SciPy dependency from >=0.17.1 to >=0.18
   - ScoreVisualizer now subclasses ModelVisualizer; towards allowing both fitted and unfitted models passed to Visualizers
   - Added CI tests for Python 3.6 compatibility
   - Added new quickstart guide and install instructions
   - Updates to the contributors documentation
   - Added ``distortion_score`` and ``calinski_harabaz_score`` computations and visualizations to KMeans visualizer.
   - Replaced the ``self.ax`` property on all of the individual ``draw`` methods with a new property on the ``Visualizer`` class that ensures all visualizers automatically have axes.
   - Refactored the utils module into a package
   - Continuing to update the docstrings to conform to Sphinx
   - Added a prototype visual pipeline class that extends the scikit-learn pipeline class to ensure that visualizers get called correctly.

Bug Fixes:
   - Fixed title bug in Rank2D FeatureVisualizer

Version 0.4
-----------
This release is the culmination of the Spring 2017 DDL Research Labs that focused on developing Yellowbrick as a community effort guided by a sprint/agile workflow. We added several more visualizers, did a lot of user testing and bug fixes, updated the documentation, and generally discovered how best to make Yellowbrick a friendly project to contribute to.

Notable in this release is the inclusion of two new feature visualizers that use few, simple dimensions to visualize features against the target. The ``JointPlotVisualizer`` graphs a scatter plot of two dimensions in the data set and plots a best fit line across it. The ``ScatterVisualizer`` also uses two features, but also colors the graph by the target variable, adding a third dimension to the visualization.

This release also adds support for clustering visualizations, namely the elbow method for selecting K, ``KElbowVisualizer`` and a visualization of cluster size and density using the ``SilhouetteVisualizer``. The release also adds support for regularization analysis using the ``AlphaSelection`` visualizer. Both the text and classification modules were also improved with the inclusion of the ``PosTagVisualizer`` and the ``ConfusionMatrix`` visualizer respectively.

This release also added an Anaconda repository and distribution so that users can ``conda install`` yellowbrick. Even more notable, we got Yellowbrick stickers! We've also updated the documentation to make it more friendly and a bit more visual; fixing the API rendering errors. All-in-all, this was a big release with a lot of contributions and we thank everyone that participated in the lab!

Version 0.3.3
-------------
Intermediate sprint to demonstrate prototype implementations of text visualizers for NLP models. Primary contributions were the ``FreqDistVisualizer`` and the ``TSNEVisualizer``.

The ``TSNEVisualizer`` displays a projection of a vectorized corpus in two dimensions using TSNE, a nonlinear dimensionality reduction method that is particularly well suited to embedding in two or three dimensions for visualization as a scatter plot. TSNE is widely used in text analysis to show clusters or groups of documents or utterances and their relative proximities.

The ``FreqDistVisualizer`` implements frequency distribution plot that tells us the frequency of each vocabulary item in the text. In general, it could count any kind of observable event. It is a distribution because it tells us how the total number of word tokens in the text are distributed across the vocabulary items.

* Deployed: Wednesday, February 22, 2017
* Contributors: Rebecca Bilbro, Benjamin Bengfort

Changes:
   - ``TSNEVisualizer`` for 2D projections of vectorized documents
   - ``FreqDistVisualizer`` for token frequency of text in a corpus
   - Added the user testing evaluation to the documentation
   - Created scikit-yb.org and host documentation there with RFD

   - Model selection tutorial using Mushroom Dataset
   - Created a text examples notebook but have not added to documentation.


Version 0.3.2
-------------
Hardened the Yellowbrick API to elevate the idea of a Visualizer to a first principle. This included reconciling shifts in the development of the preliminary versions to the new API, formalizing Visualizer methods like ``draw()`` and ``finalize()``, and adding utilities that revolve around scikit-learn. To that end we also performed administrative tasks like refreshing the documentation and preparing the repository for more and varied open source contributions.

* Tag: v0.3.2_
* Deployed: Friday, January 20, 2017
* Contributors: Benjamin Bengfort, Rebecca Bilbro

Changes:

   - Updated docstrings for all Visualizers and functions
   - Created a DataVisualizer base class for dataset visualization
   - Single call functions for simple visualizer interaction
   - Added yellowbrick specific color sequences and palettes and env handling

Hotfix 0.3.1
-------------
Hotfix to solve pip install issues with Yellowbrick.

* Tag: v0.3.1_
* Deployed: Monday, October 10, 2016
* Contributors: Benjamin Bengfort

  Changes:
     - Modified packaging and wheel for Python 2.7 and 3.5 compatibility
     - Modified deployment to PyPI and pip install ability
     - Fixed Travis-CI tests with the backend failures.

Version 0.3
-----------
This release marks a major change from the previous MVP releases as Yellowbrick moves towards direct integration with scikit-learn for visual diagnostics and steering of machine learning and could therefore be considered the first alpha release of the library. To that end we have created a Visualizer model which extends ``sklearn.base.BaseEstimator`` and can be used directly in the ML Pipeline. There are a number of visualizers that can be used throughout the model selection process, including for feature analysis, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning.

In this release specifically, we focused on visualizers in the data space for feature analysis and visualizers in the model space for scoring and evaluating models. Future releases will extend these base classes and add more functionality.

* Tag: v0.3_
* Deployed: Sunday, October 9, 2016
* Contributors: Benjamin Bengfort, Rebecca Bilbro, Marius van Niekerk

  Enhancements:
   - Created an API for visualization with machine learning: Visualizers that are ``BaseEstimators``.
   - Created a class hierarchy for Visualizers throughout the ML process particularly feature analysis and model evaluation
   - Visualizer interface is draw method which can be called multiple times on data or model spaces and a poof method to finalize the figure and display or save to disk.
   - ``ScoreVisualizers`` wrap scikit-learn estimators and implement ``fit()`` and ``predict()`` (pass-throughs to the estimator) and also score which calls draw in order to visually score the estimator. If the estimator isn't appropriate for the scoring method an exception is raised.
   - ``ROCAUC`` is a ``ScoreVisualizer`` that plots the receiver operating characteristic curve and displays the area under the curve score.
   - ``ClassificationReport`` is a ``ScoreVisualizer`` that renders the confusion matrix of a classifier as a heatmap.
   - ``PredictionError`` is a ``ScoreVisualizer`` that plots the actual vs. predicted values and the 45 degree accuracy line for regressors.
   - ``ResidualPlot`` is a ``ScoreVisualizer`` that plots the residuals (y - yhat) across the actual values (y) with the zero accuracy line for both train and test sets.
   - ``ClassBalance`` is a ``ScoreVisualizer`` that displays the support for each class as a bar plot.
   - ``FeatureVisualizers`` are scikit-learn Transformers that implement ``fit()`` and ``transform()`` and operate on the data space, calling draw to display instances.
   - ``ParallelCoordinates`` plots instances with class across each feature dimension as line segments across a horizontal space.
   - ``RadViz`` plots instances with class in a circular space where each feature dimension is an arc around the circumference and points are plotted relative to the weight of the feature.
   - ``Rank2D`` plots pairwise scores of features as a heatmap in the space [-1, 1] to show relative importance of features. Currently implemented ranking functions are Pearson correlation and covariance.
   - Coordinated and added palettes in the bgrmyck space and implemented a version of the Seaborn set_palette and set_color_codes functions as well as the ``ColorPalette`` object and other matplotlib.rc modifications.
   - Inherited Seaborn's notebook context and whitegrid axes style but make them the default, don't allow user to modify (if they'd like to, they'll have to import Seaborn). This gives Yellowbrick a consistent look and feel without giving too much work to the user and prepares us for matplotlib 2.0.
   - Jupyter Notebook with Examples of all Visualizers and usage.

  Bug Fixes:
   - Fixed Travis-CI test failures with matplotlib.use('Agg').
   - Fixed broken link to Quickstart on README
   - Refactor of the original API to the scikit-learn Visualizer API
