* Deployed: Not yet deployed
* Contributors: Benjamin Bengfort, Rebecca Bilbro, Nathan Danielsen, Kristen McIntyre, Larry Gray, Prema Roman, Ry Whittington, John Healy, Sourav Singh, Francois Dion, Jerome Massot, Zijie (ZJ) Poh, Rohit Ganapathy, Nabanita Dash, Justin Ormont

.. warning:: **Python 2 Deprecation**: Please note that this release deprecates Yellowbrick's support for Python 2.7. After careful consideration and following the lead of our primary dependencies (NumPy, scikit-learn, and Matplolib), we have chosen to move forward with the community and support Python 3.4 and later.

Major Changes:
    - New ``JointPlot`` visualizer that is specifically designed for machine learning. The new visualizer can compare a feature to a target, features to features, and even feature to feature to target using color. The visualizer gives correlation information at a glance and is designed to work on ML datasets.
    - New ``PosTagVisualizer`` is specifically designed for diagnostics around natural language processing and grammar-based feature extraction for machine learning. This new visualizer shows counts of different parts-of-speech throughout a tagged corpus.
    - New datasets module that provide greater support for interacting with Yellowbrick example datasets including support for Pandas, npz, and text corpora.
    - Management repository for Yellowbrick example data, yellowbrick-datasets.
    - Add support for matplotlib 3.0.1 or greater.
    - ``UMAPVisualizer`` as an alternative manifold to TSNE for corpus visualization that is fast enough to not require preprocessing PCA or SVD decomposition and preserves higher order similarities and distances.
    - Added ``..plot::`` directives to the documentation to automatically build the images along with the docs and keep them as up to date as possible. The directives also include the source code making it much simpler to recreate examples.

Minor Changes:
    - Updated Rank2D to include Kendall-Tau metric.
    - Added ``target_color_type`` functionality to determine continuous or discrete color representations based on the type of the target variable.
    - Added user specification of ISO F1 values to ``PrecisionRecallCurve`` and updated the quick method to accept train and test splits.
    - Added code review checklist and conventions to the documentation and expanded the contributing docs to include other tricks and tips.
    - Added polish to missing value visualizers code, tests, and documentation.
    - Improved RankD tests for better coverage.
    - Added quick method test for ``DispersionPlot`` visualizer.
    - BugFix: fixed resolve colors bug in TSNE and UMAP text visualizers and added regression tests to prevent future errors.
    - BugFix: fixed ``PrecisionRecallCurve`` visual display problem with multi-class labels.
    - BugFix: fixed the ``RFECV`` step display bug.
    - Extended FeatureImportances documentation and tests for stacked importances and added a warning when stack should be true.
    - Improved the documentation readability and structure.
    - Refreshed the README.md and added testing and documentation READMEs.
    - Updated the gallery to generate thumbnail-quality images.
    - Updated the example notebooks and created a quickstart notebook.
    - Fixed broken links in the documentation.

Compatibility Notes:
    - This version provides support for matplotlib 3.0.1 or greater and drops support for matplotlib versions less than 2.0.
    - This version drops support for Python 2

Hotfix 0.4.2
------------

Update to the deployment docs and package on both Anaconda and PyPI.

* Tag: v0.4.2_
* Deployed: Monday, May 22, 2017
* Contributors: Benjamin Bengfort, Jason Keung

.. _v0.4.2: https://github.com/DistrictDataLabs/yellowbrick/releases/tag/v0.4.2


Version 0.4.1
-------------
This release is an intermediate version bump in anticipation of the PyCon 2017 sprints.

The primary goals of this version were to (1) update the Yellowbrick dependencies (2) enhance the Yellowbrick documentation to help orient new users and contributors, and (3) make several small additions and upgrades (e.g. pulling the Yellowbrick utils into a standalone module).

We have updated the scikit-learn and SciPy dependencies from version 0.17.1 or later to 0.18 or later. This primarily entails moving from ``from sklearn.cross_validation import train_test_split`` to ``from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split``.

The updates to the documentation include new Quickstart and Installation guides, as well as updates to the Contributors documentation, which is modeled on the scikit-learn contributing documentation.

This version also included upgrades to the KMeans visualizer, which now supports not only ``silhouette_score`` but also ``distortion_score`` and ``calinski_harabaz_score``. The ``distortion_score`` computes the mean distortion of all samples as the sum of the squared distances between each observation and its closest centroid. This is the metric that KMeans attempts to minimize as it is fitting the model. The ``calinski_harabaz_score`` is defined as ratio between the within-cluster dispersion and the between-cluster dispersion.

Finally, this release includes a prototype of the ``VisualPipeline``, which extends scikit-learn's ``Pipeline`` class, allowing multiple Visualizers to be chained or sequenced together.

* Tag: v0.4.1_
* Deployed: Monday, May 22, 2017
* Contributors: Benjamin Bengfort, Rebecca Bilbro, Nathan Danielsen

Changes:
   - Score and model visualizers now wrap estimators as proxies so that all methods on the estimator can be directly accessed from the visualizer
   - Updated scikit-learn dependency from >=0.17.1  to >=0.18
   - Replaced ``sklearn.cross_validation`` with ``model_selection``
   - Updated SciPy dependency from >=0.17.1 to >=0.18
   - ScoreVisualizer now subclasses ModelVisualizer; towards allowing both fitted and unfitted models passed to Visualizers
   - Added CI tests for Python 3.6 compatibility
   - Added new quickstart guide and install instructions
   - Updates to the contributors documentation
   - Added ``distortion_score`` and ``calinski_harabaz_score`` computations and visualizations to KMeans visualizer.
   - Replaced the ``self.ax`` property on all of the individual ``draw`` methods with a new property on the ``Visualizer`` class that ensures all visualizers automatically have axes.
   - Refactored the utils module into a package
   - Continuing to update the docstrings to conform to Sphinx
   - Added a prototype visual pipeline class that extends the scikit-learn pipeline class to ensure that visualizers get called correctly.

Bug Fixes:
   - Fixed title bug in Rank2D FeatureVisualizer

.. _v0.4.1: https://github.com/DistrictDataLabs/yellowbrick/releases/tag/v0.4.1


Version 0.4
-----------
This release is the culmination of the Spring 2017 DDL Research Labs that focused on developing Yellowbrick as a community effort guided by a sprint/agile workflow. We added several more visualizers, did a lot of user testing and bug fixes, updated the documentation, and generally discovered how best to make Yellowbrick a friendly project to contribute to.

Notable in this release is the inclusion of two new feature visualizers that use few, simple dimensions to visualize features against the target. The ``JointPlotVisualizer`` graphs a scatter plot of two dimensions in the data set and plots a best fit line across it. The ``ScatterVisualizer`` also uses two features, but also colors the graph by the target variable, adding a third dimension to the visualization.

This release also adds support for clustering visualizations, namely the elbow method for selecting K, ``KElbowVisualizer`` and a visualization of cluster size and density using the ``SilhouetteVisualizer``. The release also adds support for regularization analysis using the ``AlphaSelection`` visualizer. Both the text and classification modules were also improved with the inclusion of the ``PosTagVisualizer`` and the ``ConfusionMatrix`` visualizer respectively.

This release also added an Anaconda repository and distribution so that users can ``conda install`` yellowbrick. Even more notable, we got Yellowbrick stickers! We've also updated the documentation to make it more friendly and a bit more visual; fixing the API rendering errors. All-in-all, this was a big release with a lot of contributions and we thank everyone that participated in the lab!

Version 0.3.3
-------------
Intermediate sprint to demonstrate prototype implementations of text visualizers for NLP models. Primary contributions were the ``FreqDistVisualizer`` and the ``TSNEVisualizer``.

The ``TSNEVisualizer`` displays a projection of a vectorized corpus in two dimensions using TSNE, a nonlinear dimensionality reduction method that is particularly well suited to embedding in two or three dimensions for visualization as a scatter plot. TSNE is widely used in text analysis to show clusters or groups of documents or utterances and their relative proximities.

The ``FreqDistVisualizer`` implements frequency distribution plot that tells us the frequency of each vocabulary item in the text. In general, it could count any kind of observable event. It is a distribution because it tells us how the total number of word tokens in the text are distributed across the vocabulary items.

* Tag: v0.3.3_
* Deployed: Wednesday, February 22, 2017
* Contributors: Rebecca Bilbro, Benjamin Bengfort

Changes:
   - ``TSNEVisualizer`` for 2D projections of vectorized documents

Version 0.3.2
-------------
Hardened the Yellowbrick API to elevate the idea of a Visualizer to a first principle. This included reconciling shifts in the development of the preliminary versions to the new API, formalizing Visualizer methods like ``draw()`` and ``finalize()``, and adding utilities that revolve around scikit-learn. To that end we also performed administrative tasks like refreshing the documentation and preparing the repository for more and varied open source contributions.

* Tag: v0.3.2_

* Tag: v0.3.1_
* Deployed: Monday, October 10, 2016
* Contributors: Benjamin Bengfort

  Changes:
     - Modified packaging and wheel for Python 2.7 and 3.5 compatibility
     - Modified deployment to PyPI and pip install ability
     - Fixed Travis-CI tests with the backend failures.

Version 0.3
-----------
This release marks a major change from the previous MVP releases as Yellowbrick moves towards direct integration with scikit-learn for visual diagnostics and steering of machine learning and could therefore be considered the first alpha release of the library. To that end we have created a Visualizer model which extends ``sklearn.base.BaseEstimator`` and can be used directly in the ML Pipeline. There are a number of visualizers that can be used throughout the model selection process, including for feature analysis, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning.

In this release specifically, we focused on visualizers in the data space for feature analysis and visualizers in the model space for scoring and evaluating models. Future releases will extend these base classes and add more functionality.

* Tag: v0.3_
* Deployed: Sunday, October 9, 2016
* Contributors: Benjamin Bengfort, Rebecca Bilbro, Marius van Niekerk

  Enhancements:
   - Created an API for visualization with machine learning: Visualizers that are ``BaseEstimators``.
   - Created a class hierarchy for Visualizers throughout the ML process particularly feature analysis and model evaluation
   - Visualizer interface is draw method which can be called multiple times on data or model spaces and a poof method to finalize the figure and display or save to disk.
   - ``ScoreVisualizers`` wrap scikit-learn estimators and implement ``fit()`` and ``predict()`` (pass-throughs to the estimator) and also score which calls draw in order to visually score the estimator. If the estimator isn't appropriate for the scoring method an exception is raised.
   - ``ROCAUC`` is a ``ScoreVisualizer`` that plots the receiver operating characteristic curve and displays the area under the curve score.
   - ``ClassificationReport`` is a ``ScoreVisualizer`` that renders the confusion matrix of a classifier as a heatmap.
   - ``PredictionError`` is a ``ScoreVisualizer`` that plots the actual vs. predicted values and the 45 degree accuracy line for regressors.
   - ``ResidualPlot`` is a ``ScoreVisualizer`` that plots the residuals (y - yhat) across the actual values (y) with the zero accuracy line for both train and test sets.
   - ``ClassBalance`` is a ``ScoreVisualizer`` that displays the support for each class as a bar plot.
   - ``FeatureVisualizers`` are scikit-learn Transformers that implement ``fit()`` and ``transform()`` and operate on the data space, calling draw to display instances.
   - ``ParallelCoordinates`` plots instances with class across each feature dimension as line segments across a horizontal space.
   - ``RadViz`` plots instances with class in a circular space where each feature dimension is an arc around the circumference and points are plotted relative to the weight of the feature.
   - ``Rank2D`` plots pairwise scores of features as a heatmap in the space [-1, 1] to show relative importance of features. Currently implemented ranking functions are Pearson correlation and covariance.
   - Coordinated and added palettes in the bgrmyck space and implemented a version of the Seaborn set_palette and set_color_codes functions as well as the ``ColorPalette`` object and other matplotlib.rc modifications.
   - Inherited Seaborn's notebook context and whitegrid axes style but make them the default, don't allow user to modify (if they'd like to, they'll have to import Seaborn). This gives Yellowbrick a consistent look and feel without giving too much work to the user and prepares us for matplotlib 2.0.
   - Jupyter Notebook with Examples of all Visualizers and usage.

  Bug Fixes:
   - Fixed Travis-CI test failures with matplotlib.use('Agg').
   - Fixed broken link to Quickstart on README
   - Refactor of the original API to the scikit-learn Visualizer API
