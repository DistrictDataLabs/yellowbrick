Changes:
   - *New Feature!* The ``FeatureImportances`` Visualizer enables the user to visualize the most informative (relative and absolute) features in their model, plotting a bar graph of ``feature_importances_`` or ``coef_`` attributes.
   - *New Feature!* The ``ExplainedVariance`` Visualizer produces a plot of the explained variance resulting from a dimensionality reduction to help identify the best tradeoff between number of dimensions and amount of information retained from the data.
   - *New Feature!* The ``GridSearchVisualizer`` creates a color plot showing the best grid search scores across two parameters.
   - *New Feature!* The ``ClassPredictionError`` Visualizer is a heatmap implementation of the class balance visualizer, which provides a way to quickly understand how successfully your classifier is predicting the correct classes.
   - *New Feature!* The ``ThresholdVisualizer`` allows the user to visualize the bounds of precision, recall and queue rate at different thresholds for binary targets after a given number of trials.
   - New ``MultiFeatureVisualizer`` helper class to provide base functionality for getting the names of features for use in plot annotation.
   - Adds font size param to the confusion matrix to adjust its visibility.
   - Add quick method for the confusion matrix
   - Tests: In this version, we've switched from using nose to pytest. Image comparison tests have been added and the visual tests are updated to matplotlib 2.2.0. Test coverage has also been improved for a number of visualizers, including ``JointPlot``, ``AlphaPlot``, ``FreqDist``, ``RadViz``, ``ElbowPlot``, ``SilhouettePlot``, ``ConfusionMatrix``, ``Rank1D``, and ``Rank2D``.
   - Documentation updates, including discussion of Image Comparison Tests for contributors.

Bug Fixes:
   - Fixes the ``resolve_colors`` function. You can now pass in a number of colors and a colormap and get back the correct number of colors.
   - Fixes ``TSNEVisualizer`` Value Error when no classes are specified.
   - Adds the circle back to ``RadViz``! This visualizer has also been updated to ensure there's a visualization even when there are missing values
   - Updated ``RocAuc`` to correctly check the number of classes
   - Switch from converting structured arrays to ndarrays using ``np.copy`` instead of ``np.tolist`` to avoid NumPy deprecation warning.
   - ``DataVisualizer`` updated to remove ``np.nan`` values and warn the user that nans are not plotted.
   - ``ClassificationReport`` no longer has lines that run through the numbers, is more grid-like

Deprecation Warnings:
   - ``ScatterPlotVisualizer`` is being moved to contrib in 0.7
   - ``DecisionBoundaryVisualizer`` is being moved to contrib in 0.7

Hotfix 0.4.2
------------

Update to the deployment docs and package on both Anaconda and PyPI.

* Tag: v0.4.2_
* Deployed: Monday, May 22, 2017
* Contributors: Benjamin Bengfort, Jason Keung

.. _v0.4.2: https://github.com/DistrictDataLabs/yellowbrick/releases/tag/v0.4.2


Version 0.4.1
-------------
This release is an intermediate version bump in anticipation of the PyCon 2017 sprints.

The primary goals of this version were to (1) update the Yellowbrick dependencies (2) enhance the Yellowbrick documentation to help orient new users and contributors, and (3) make several small additions and upgrades (e.g. pulling the Yellowbrick utils into a standalone module).

We have updated the scikit-learn and SciPy dependencies from version 0.17.1 or later to 0.18 or later. This primarily entails moving from ``from sklearn.cross_validation import train_test_split`` to ``from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split``.

The updates to the documentation include new Quickstart and Installation guides, as well as updates to the Contributors documentation, which is modeled on the scikit-learn contributing documentation.

This version also included upgrades to the KMeans visualizer, which now supports not only ``silhouette_score`` but also ``distortion_score`` and ``calinski_harabaz_score``. The ``distortion_score`` computes the mean distortion of all samples as the sum of the squared distances between each observation and its closest centroid. This is the metric that KMeans attempts to minimize as it is fitting the model. The ``calinski_harabaz_score`` is defined as ratio between the within-cluster dispersion and the between-cluster dispersion.

Finally, this release includes a prototype of the ``VisualPipeline``, which extends scikit-learn's ``Pipeline`` class, allowing multiple Visualizers to be chained or sequenced together.

* Tag: v0.4.1_
* Deployed: Monday, May 22, 2017
* Contributors: Benjamin Bengfort, Rebecca Bilbro, Nathan Danielsen

Changes:
   - Score and model visualizers now wrap estimators as proxies so that all methods on the estimator can be directly accessed from the visualizer
   - Updated scikit-learn dependency from >=0.17.1  to >=0.18
   - Replaced ``sklearn.cross_validation`` with ``model_selection``
   - Updated SciPy dependency from >=0.17.1 to >=0.18
   - ScoreVisualizer now subclasses ModelVisualizer; towards allowing both fitted and unfitted models passed to Visualizers
   - Added CI tests for Python 3.6 compatibility
   - Added new quickstart guide and install instructions
   - Updates to the contributors documentation
   - Added ``distortion_score`` and ``calinski_harabaz_score`` computations and visualizations to KMeans visualizer.
   - Replaced the ``self.ax`` property on all of the individual ``draw`` methods with a new property on the ``Visualizer`` class that ensures all visualizers automatically have axes.
   - Refactored the utils module into a package
   - Continuing to update the docstrings to conform to Sphinx
   - Added a prototype visual pipeline class that extends the scikit-learn pipeline class to ensure that visualizers get called correctly.

Bug Fixes:
   - Fixed title bug in Rank2D FeatureVisualizer

.. _v0.4.1: https://github.com/DistrictDataLabs/yellowbrick/releases/tag/v0.4.1


Version 0.4
-----------
This release is the culmination of the Spring 2017 DDL Research Labs that focused on developing Yellowbrick as a community effort guided by a sprint/agile workflow. We added several more visualizers, did a lot of user testing and bug fixes, updated the documentation, and generally discovered how best to make Yellowbrick a friendly project to contribute to.

Notable in this release is the inclusion of two new feature visualizers that use few, simple dimensions to visualize features against the target. The ``JointPlotVisualizer`` graphs a scatter plot of two dimensions in the data set and plots a best fit line across it. The ``ScatterVisualizer`` also uses two features, but also colors the graph by the target variable, adding a third dimension to the visualization.

This release also adds support for clustering visualizations, namely the elbow method for selecting K, ``KElbowVisualizer`` and a visualization of cluster size and density using the ``SilhouetteVisualizer``. The release also adds support for regularization analysis using the ``AlphaSelection`` visualizer. Both the text and classification modules were also improved with the inclusion of the ``PosTagVisualizer`` and the ``ConfusionMatrix`` visualizer respectively.

This release also added an Anaconda repository and distribution so that users can ``conda install`` yellowbrick. Even more notable, we got Yellowbrick stickers! We've also updated the documentation to make it more friendly and a bit more visual; fixing the API rendering errors. All-in-all, this was a big release with a lot of contributions and we thank everyone that participated in the lab!

Version 0.3.3
-------------
Intermediate sprint to demonstrate prototype implementations of text visualizers for NLP models. Primary contributions were the ``FreqDistVisualizer`` and the ``TSNEVisualizer``.

The ``TSNEVisualizer`` displays a projection of a vectorized corpus in two dimensions using TSNE, a nonlinear dimensionality reduction method that is particularly well suited to embedding in two or three dimensions for visualization as a scatter plot. TSNE is widely used in text analysis to show clusters or groups of documents or utterances and their relative proximities.

The ``FreqDistVisualizer`` implements frequency distribution plot that tells us the frequency of each vocabulary item in the text. In general, it could count any kind of observable event. It is a distribution because it tells us how the total number of word tokens in the text are distributed across the vocabulary items.

* Tag: v0.3.3_
* Deployed: Wednesday, February 22, 2017
* Contributors: Rebecca Bilbro, Benjamin Bengfort

Changes:
   - ``TSNEVisualizer`` for 2D projections of vectorized documents
   - ``FreqDistVisualizer`` for token frequency of text in a corpus
   - Added the user testing evaluation to the documentation
   - Created scikit-yb.org and host documentation there with RFD
   - Created a sample corpus and text examples notebook
   - Created a base class for text, ``TextVisualizer``
   - Model selection tutorial using Mushroom Dataset
   - Created a text examples notebook but have not added to documentation.


Version 0.3.2
-------------
Hardened the Yellowbrick API to elevate the idea of a Visualizer to a first principle. This included reconciling shifts in the development of the preliminary versions to the new API, formalizing Visualizer methods like ``draw()`` and ``finalize()``, and adding utilities that revolve around scikit-learn. To that end we also performed administrative tasks like refreshing the documentation and preparing the repository for more and varied open source contributions.

* Tag: v0.3.2_
* Deployed: Friday, January 20, 2017
* Contributors: Benjamin Bengfort, Rebecca Bilbro

Changes:
   - Converted Mkdocs documentation to Sphinx documentation
   - Updated docstrings for all Visualizers and functions
   - Created a DataVisualizer base class for dataset visualization
   - Single call functions for simple visualizer interaction
   - Added yellowbrick specific color sequences and palettes and env handling
   - More robust examples with downloader from DDL host
   - Better axes handling in visualizer, matplotlib/sklearn integration

Hotfix 0.3.1
-------------
Hotfix to solve pip install issues with Yellowbrick.

* Tag: v0.3.1_
* Deployed: Monday, October 10, 2016
* Contributors: Benjamin Bengfort

  Changes:
     - Modified packaging and wheel for Python 2.7 and 3.5 compatibility
     - Modified deployment to PyPI and pip install ability
     - Fixed Travis-CI tests with the backend failures.

Version 0.3
-----------
This release marks a major change from the previous MVP releases as Yellowbrick moves towards direct integration with scikit-learn for visual diagnostics and steering of machine learning and could therefore be considered the first alpha release of the library. To that end we have created a Visualizer model which extends ``sklearn.base.BaseEstimator`` and can be used directly in the ML Pipeline. There are a number of visualizers that can be used throughout the model selection process, including for feature analysis, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning.

In this release specifically, we focused on visualizers in the data space for feature analysis and visualizers in the model space for scoring and evaluating models. Future releases will extend these base classes and add more functionality.

* Tag: v0.3_
* Deployed: Sunday, October 9, 2016
* Contributors: Benjamin Bengfort, Rebecca Bilbro, Marius van Niekerk

  Enhancements:
   - Created an API for visualization with machine learning: Visualizers that are ``BaseEstimators``.
   - Created a class hierarchy for Visualizers throughout the ML process particularly feature analysis and model evaluation
   - Visualizer interface is draw method which can be called multiple times on data or model spaces and a poof method to finalize the figure and display or save to disk.
   - ``ScoreVisualizers`` wrap scikit-learn estimators and implement ``fit()`` and ``predict()`` (pass-throughs to the estimator) and also score which calls draw in order to visually score the estimator. If the estimator isn't appropriate for the scoring method an exception is raised.
   - ``ROCAUC`` is a ``ScoreVisualizer`` that plots the receiver operating characteristic curve and displays the area under the curve score.
   - ``ClassificationReport`` is a ``ScoreVisualizer`` that renders the confusion matrix of a classifier as a heatmap.
   - ``PredictionError`` is a ``ScoreVisualizer`` that plots the actual vs. predicted values and the 45 degree accuracy line for regressors.
   - ``ResidualPlot`` is a ``ScoreVisualizer`` that plots the residuals (y - yhat) across the actual values (y) with the zero accuracy line for both train and test sets.
   - ``ClassBalance`` is a ``ScoreVisualizer`` that displays the support for each class as a bar plot.
   - ``FeatureVisualizers`` are scikit-learn Transformers that implement ``fit()`` and ``transform()`` and operate on the data space, calling draw to display instances.
   - ``ParallelCoordinates`` plots instances with class across each feature dimension as line segments across a horizontal space.
   - ``RadViz`` plots instances with class in a circular space where each feature dimension is an arc around the circumference and points are plotted relative to the weight of the feature.
   - ``Rank2D`` plots pairwise scores of features as a heatmap in the space [-1, 1] to show relative importance of features. Currently implemented ranking functions are Pearson correlation and covariance.
   - Coordinated and added palettes in the bgrmyck space and implemented a version of the Seaborn set_palette and set_color_codes functions as well as the ``ColorPalette`` object and other matplotlib.rc modifications.
   - Inherited Seaborn's notebook context and whitegrid axes style but make them the default, don't allow user to modify (if they'd like to, they'll have to import Seaborn). This gives Yellowbrick a consistent look and feel without giving too much work to the user and prepares us for matplotlib 2.0.
   - Jupyter Notebook with Examples of all Visualizers and usage.

  Bug Fixes:
   - Fixed Travis-CI test failures with matplotlib.use('Agg').
   - Fixed broken link to Quickstart on README
   - Refactor of the original API to the scikit-learn Visualizer API
