Operating Budget
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following operating budget is proposed for 2020.

The board discussed a minor increase in operating costs from the previous year and acknowledged a 2020 budget of **$271.48** and **$30.17** advisor member dues per person. Because of the minimal change, the board is leaving the final budget open to any additional proposed expenses until the end of January.

Fall 2019 Retrospective
-----------------------

In traditional agile development, sprints are concluded with a retrospective to discuss what went well, what didn't go well, what were unexpected challenges, and how we can adapt to those challenges in the future. Generally these meetings exclude the major stakeholders so that the contributors to the sprint can speak freely. Because the Board of Advisors are the major stakeholders of the Yellowbrick project, there was an intermediate retrospective with just the maintainers of the Summer 2019 semester so they could communicate anonymously and frankly with the Board. Their feedback as well as additions by the advisors follow.
