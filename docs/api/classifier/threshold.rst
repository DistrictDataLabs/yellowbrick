Threshold
=========

The Threshold visualizer shows the bounds of precision, recall, and queue rate for different thresholds for binary targets after a given number of trials.

.. code:: python

    import pandas as pd

    # Load the data set
    data = pd.read_csv("https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/spambase/spambase.data", header=None)
    data.rename(columns={57:"is_spam"}, inplace=True)

    features = [col for col in data.columns if col != "is_spam"]

    # Extract the numpy arrays from the data frame
    X = data[features].as_matrix()
    y = data.is_spam.as_matrix()

.. code:: python
    
    from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
    
    from yellowbrick.classifier import ThreshViz

    # Instantiate the classification model and visualizer
    logistic = LogisticRegression()
    visualizer = ThreshViz(logistic)

    visualizer.fit(X, y)  # Fit the training data to the visualizer
    g = visualizer.poof() # Draw/show/poof the data
