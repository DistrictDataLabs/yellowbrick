Clustering Visualizers
======================

Clustering models are unsupervised methods that attempt to detect patterns in unlabeled data. There are two primary classes of clustering algorithm: *agglomerative* clustering links similar data points together, whereas *centroidal* clustering attempts to find centers or partitions in the data. Yellowbrick provides the ``yellowbrick.cluster`` module to visualize and evaluate clustering behavior. Currently we provide several visualizers to evaluate centroidal mechanisms, particularly K-Means clustering, that help us to discover an optimal :math:`K` parameter in the clustering metric:

-  :doc:`elbow`: visualize the clusters according to some scoring function, look for an "elbow" in the curve.
-  :doc:`silhouette`: visualize the silhouette scores of each cluster in a single model.
- :doc:`icdm`: visualize the relative distance and size of clusters.

Because it is very difficult to ``score`` a clustering model, Yellowbrick visualizers wrap scikit-learn clusterer estimators via their ``fit()`` method. Once the clustering model is trained, then the visualizer can call ``poof()`` to display the clustering evaluation metric.
