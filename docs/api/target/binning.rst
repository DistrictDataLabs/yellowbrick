Balanced Binning Reference
==========================

Frequently, machine learning problems in the real world suffer from the curse of dimensionality; you have fewer training instances than you'd like and the predictive signal is distributed (often unpredictably!) across many different features.

Sometimes when the your target variable is continuously-valued, there simply aren't enough instances to predict these values to the precision of regression. In this case, we can sometimes transform the regression problem into a classification problem by binning the continuous values into makeshift classes.

To help the user select the optimal number of bins, the ``BalancedBinningReference`` visualizer takes the target variable ``y`` as input and generates a histogram with vertical lines indicating the recommended value points to ensure that the data is evenly distributed into each bin.

    from yellowbrick.target import BalancedBinningReference

    # Load the concrete dataset
    X, y = load_concrete()

    # Instantiate the visualizer
    visualizer = BalancedBinningReference()

    visualizer.fit(y)        # Fit the data to the visualizer
    visualizer.poof()        # Draw/show/poof the data
