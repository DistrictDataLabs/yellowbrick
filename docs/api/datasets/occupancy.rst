Occupancy
=========

Experimental data used for binary classification (room occupancy) from Temperature, Humidity, Light and CO2. Ground-truth occupancy was obtained from time stamped pictures that were taken every minute.

=================   ===============
Classes                           2
Samples per class        imbalanced
Samples total                 20560
Dimensionality                    5
Features             real, positive
