Occupancy
=========

Experimental data used for binary classification (room occupancy) from Temperature, Humidity, Light and CO2. Ground-truth occupancy was obtained from time stamped pictures that were taken every minute.

Description
-----------

Three data sets are submitted, for training and testing. Ground-truth occupancy was obtained from time stamped pictures that were taken every minute. For the journal publication, the processing R scripts can be found on `GitHub <https://github.com/LuisM78/Occupancy-detection-data>`_.
