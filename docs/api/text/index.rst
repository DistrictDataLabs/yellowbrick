Text Modeling Visualizers
=========================

Yellowbrick provides the ``yellowbrick.text`` module for text-specific visualizers. The ``TextVisualizer`` class specifically deals with datasets that are corpora and not simple numeric arrays or DataFrames, providing utilities for analyzing word dispersion and distribution, showing document similarity, or simply wrapping some of the other standard visualizers with text-specific display properties.

We currently have four text-specific visualizations implemented:

-  :doc:`freqdist`: plot the frequency of tokens in a corpus
-  :doc:`tsne`: plot similar documents closer together to discover clusters
-  :doc:`umap_vis`: plot similar documents closer together to discover clusters
-  :doc:`dispersion`: plot the dispersion of target words throughout a corpus
-  :doc:`postag`: plot the counts of different parts-of-speech throughout a tagged corpus

Note that the examples in this section require a corpus of text data, see :doc:`loading a text corpus <corpus>` for more information.
