# Test requirements are fixed in order to make CI tests less susceptible to
# dependency changes. Test dependencies should be reviewed frequently so that
# we're testing against the latest versions of our dependencies that our users
# are probably using. We recommend monitoring Libraries.io to alert for changes.
